# ECE 457A: Simulated Annealing to find the global minimum on Easom function

To run this program:

```bash
python3 457A_A2_Q1.py
```

And the following graphs as PNG files will be generated:
1. Experiment 1.png - varying initial points
2. Experiment 2.png - varying initial temperatures
3. Experiment 3.png - varying annealing rates
